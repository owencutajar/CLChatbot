These can be \nissued on either a life assurance basis or on a capital \nredemption basis and you must choose which of these \noptions applies from the outset.\nIts aims are:\n\u2022  To provide the potential for long term, capital growth by  \n offering access to a very wide investment universe\n\u2022 To let you vary your choice of investments over time, to  \n match any changes in your circumstances or attitude to  \n investment risk\n\u2022 To allow you tax efficient access to your Account, through  \n regular or one-off withdrawals\n\u2022 To provide additional estate and tax planning  \n opportunities through a range of suitable trustsWhat are the differences between issuing \nan Account on a life assurance or a capital \nredemption basis? \nIf you choose the life assurance basis, at least one, or up to six \nindividuals are nominated as a life assured on the Account. \nWhere there is only one life assured, the Account will end on \nfull surrender or the life assured\u2019s death, whichever occurs \nfirst. Where there are multiple lives assured the Account \nends on the death of the last of the lives assured to die or on \nfull surrender, whichever occurs first. In the event of a death \nclaim, we pay the policy value at the time of notification of \nthe relevant life assured\u2019s death, plus an additional \u00a3100 (or \ncurrency equivalent), less any outstanding policy charges.\nIf you choose the capital redemption bond basis, the \nAccount has no lives assured and so will not come to an end \nunexpectedly on someone\u2019s death. Instead, it has a fixed \nterm of 99 years, (although it can be fully surrendered at any \ntime before this date). At the maturity date, we guarantee \nto pay a minimum maturity value of at least 20% of the \npremium (less any withdrawals).

We can make the payments monthly, quarterly, \nhalf-yearly or yearly. We will always take regular withdrawals \nfrom across all of the policies that make up your Account. \nOne-off Withdrawals\nYou can take a one-off withdrawal from your Account at any \ntime. One-off withdrawals can be taken from across all of the \npolicies that make up your Account, or by fully surrendering \na number of those policies, or by a combination of both of \nthese options. These different options may each have different \ntax consequences and we strongly recommend that you seek \nadvice from your financial adviser before proceeding in order \nto fully understand the implications of your actions. Full surrender \nYou may surrender your Account in full at any time. However, \nwe will deduct any outstanding charges from the amount \nreturned to you.\nCan I pay for any financial advice I receive  \nfrom the account?\nFinancial adviser charges  \nYou will normally need to pay your financial adviser for \ninitial and/or any ongoing advice you receive, and we can \narrange to pay a one-off charge at the outset (before or after \nyour premium is invested) and/or a regular ongoing charge \nfrom your Account to your financial adviser for this purpose. \nAny financial adviser charges that are deducted from your \naccount will count towards your 5% tax deferred allowance \n(see \u2018What taxes are applicable?\u2019 for more details).\nFund adviser charges  \nYou may wish to appoint a fund investment adviser or \ndiscretionary fund manager to provide you with ongoing \ninvestment advice on your Account (this can be in addition to \nany financial adviser charges). Fund adviser charges do not \ncount towards your 5% tax deferred allowance (see \u2018What \ntaxes are applicable?\u2019 for more details). \nWhat happens to the money if I die?\nIf you have chosen the capital redemption basis for your \nAccount, there are no lives assured.

If you are in any doubt about your tax \nstatus you should consult your financial adviser.\nCorporation tax\nWe pay no corporate taxes in either the Isle of Man or \nthe Republic of Ireland on the capital growth or income \nwhich accrue to any of the underlying assets linked to your \nAccount. By contrast, UK life assurance funds have to pay tax \nat a rate of 20% on both income and gains.  \nCapital gains tax\nAny investment gains made as a result of switching the \nunderlying investments choices within your Account do not \ngive rise to a UK capital gains tax liability.\nAny withdrawals taken from the Account are not subject to \nCapital Gains Tax, but may be subject to income tax.\nIncome tax \nUK resident Account holders are assessed under income \ntax when certain transactions occur. These transactions are \nknown as chargeable events and if a chargeable event occurs \nwhich creates a chargeable gain, you may have income tax to \npay. The main chargeable events are:\n\u2022 For the life assurance basis, when the Account ends because  \n a life assured dies and the death benefit becomes payable\n\u2022 If the Account or any of the individual policies within it are  \n assigned to a new owner for money or money\u2019s worth \n\u2022 For the capital redemption bond basis only, when the Account  \n ends at the maturity date and the maturity value is paid\n\u2022 For any withdrawals that exceed the 5% tax-deferred  \n allowance\n\u2022 If you fully surrender the Account or any of the individual  \n policies within it\nIf a chargeable gain arises it will be assessed to income tax \nbased on your highest marginal rate of income tax at that \ntime. Top-slicing relief is available. What is the 5% tax deferred allowance? \nYou can withdraw up to 5% of your premium each year for \nup to 20 years without any immediate liability to income \ntax. This is known as the 5% tax-deferred allowance. Unused \namounts can be \u2018stored\u2019 for use in later years, including years \nbeyond year 20. Deferring an assessment to income tax may \nbe beneficial for a number of reasons, such as if you expect \nyour level of income to fall in future, or if you plan to move \nabroad away from the UK tax net. If you withdraw more \nthan a total of 5% of the premium each year, the excess will \ngive rise to an immediate income tax charge at your highest \nmarginal rate. Top-slicing relief may be available. \nThe use of adviser charge deductions from your policy will \naffect your 5% tax deferred allowance and may have tax \nimplications. It is important that you discuss these with your \nfinancial adviser.\nInheritance tax \nMore and more people are finding that their estates could be \nsubject to inheritance tax, particularly because of the rapid \nrise in property values over recent decades.  \nWe offer a number of trust options which can be used to help \nto reduce the impact of inheritance tax on your estate. These \nare the Discounted Gift Trust, the Gift Trust and Gift and Loan \nTrust. \nWe also offer the Probate Trust, which has no effect on \ninheritance tax, but allows your beneficiaries to have access \nto the value of your Account on your death immediately, \nwithout the need to obtain Isle of Man or UK Grant of \nProbate. \nPlease contact your financial adviser if you require any more \ninformation on any of these trust options. \nThe information regarding taxation is based on our current \nunderstanding of UK legislation, which may change in \nfuture. How tax affects you will depend on your individual \ncircumstances.\n12  Premiere Account and Premiere Europe Account Client Guide  Premiere Account and Premiere Europe Account Client Guide  13", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f892baad-a7bf-429d-a86c-4305f1aa64c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f892baad-a7bf-429d-a86c-4305f1aa64c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Premiere Account and Premiere Europe Account Client Guide.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "354293cc-b855-4707-99bb-4190464abf4d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Premiere Account and Premiere Europe Account Client Guide.pdf"}, "hash": "a706187b63281061a43d2b52df9b6660906f608e58fae90ab93cbdbeac47ed1e"}}, "hash": "a706187b63281061a43d2b52df9b6660906f608e58fae90ab93cbdbeac47ed1e", "text": "14  Premiere Account and Premiere Europe Account Client GuideBy post  \nCanada Life House \nIsle of Man Business Park \nDouglas  \nIsle of Man  \nIM2 2QJ\nCall us \n+44 (0) 333 015 1382\nEmail us \nfocus@canadalifeint.com\nOnline \nwww.canadalife.co.ukGetting in touch\nNext steps\nThis guide has been designed to give you information \non the features of the Premiere and Premiere Europe \nAccounts.

Because we are a large company we\ncan negotiate a discount on the standard charges on behalf of our policyholders. We do not keep any of the discount that we\nreceive from the fund manager and use it to reduce the fund charges (the OCF) that our policyholders pay. The OCF is built in to\nthe daily unit price which we publish on our website.\nRisk\nThis update shows how our funds have performed over various periods of time but past performance should not be relied upon\nas a guide for how a fund may perform in the future. The value of funds can fall as well as rise and depending on market\nconditions at the time you may not get back the amount that you invested.\nAlthough all funds carry an element of risk, some funds have some more specific risks such as property funds or funds which\nspecialise in a narrow range of assets. Where funds invest in assets overseas, changes in currency exchange rates can also\naffect a fund\u2019s value.

The returns shown allow for internal fund charges. The source of the figures is FE FundInfo.\nUnits\nAll funds shown are for accumulation units unless stated otherwise.\nDerivatives\nMany funds have the ability to use derivatives with some making more use than others. Derivatives cover a wide range of types\nof investment but essentially the term describes an asset for which the value is \u2018derived\u2019 from the value of something else, such\nas a stock market index or a particular share\u2019s price. Derivatives depend on the ability of the companies involved to be able to\nmeet their obligations, so some derivatives are seen as riskier than others. The use of derivatives may be mentioned within the\nfund objective, but is commonly found in the more detailed information provided by fund managers about their funds on their\nown website.\nCanlife UK Property fund\nSpecific costs of running the UK Property fund are deducted from the income received. This is primarily a percentage of rents\nreceived. This will affect those funds that may invest in the UK Property fund such as Canlife Diversified Risk Managed 3,\nCanlife Diversified Risk Managed 4, Canlife Portfolios 3-7 and Canlife Multiple Investment.\nProperty in held in Canada Life property funds may not be sold easily. This means that investors in property funds may not\nalways be able to realise their investments when they choose. In such cases Canada Life may postpone the encashment of the\nunits in the fund by up to six months.\nThe value of property is generally a matter of a valuer\u2019s opinion rather than fact. Costs of buying and selling real property are\ngenerally much higher than for other types of assets. Property investments may be subject to significantly wider price spreads\nthan bonds and equities which could affect the valuation of the fund by up to 8.05%.\nCanlife Fidelity Global Property\nCanlife Schroder Global Cities Real Estate Securities\nThese funds differ from traditional property funds (that invest only into physical property) as they invest primarily in the shares of\nproperty companies and REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). This can mean that they may have volatility similar to equity\nfunds over the short-term. Over the long-term the performance of property share funds should be similar to that of the underlying\nproperty markets that they invest in.\nCanlife BlackRock UK Absolute Alpha\nCanlife BlackRock European Absolute Alpha\nIn addition to the standard fund charges, BlackRock may take a performance fee if the fund outperforms a stated benchmark. If\na fee is payable it is taken daily from the unit price of the fund. Further details of how the fee is calculated are available on\nrequest.\n7", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fae5a21-f4e1-4b9e-b376-3e8acd96e64a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fae5a21-f4e1-4b9e-b376-3e8acd96e64a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Select Account - Investment Performance Bulletin.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1061722-5ef8-4a59-8ee2-d1216579b3f5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Select Account - Investment Performance Bulletin.pdf"}, "hash": "7772d981b78fd7ed3b9a67e756e9ad4bd8a1079bd662e6e0d5ebc4051860de89"}}, "hash": "7772d981b78fd7ed3b9a67e756e9ad4bd8a1079bd662e6e0d5ebc4051860de89", "text": "Life Series 5\nSeptember 2023\nCanlife Ninety One Multi Asset Protector\nThe 80% protection only applies to the underlying Ninety One fund into which the Canada Life fund invests. The Canada Life\nfund protection level could be higher or lower than 80% due to factors such as cashflow, investment timing and tax.\nInvestors should note that it is intended that the protection level of 80%, of the underlying Ninety One fund share price, will be\nprovided under a derivative contract with a single counterparty, currently Deutsche Bank. If the counterparty is unable to meet its\nobligations under the derivative contract or where there is no derivative in place, then the fund will not have the same level of\nprotection and there will be a risk that the price could fall below the 80% level.\nIf the underlying Ninety One fund\u2019s share price falls, the fund may have large allocations to cash. In this situation keeping the\nfund open may no longer be in the best interests of investors. At this stage, Ninety One would consider winding up the fund.\nThere may be other circumstances which may also cause Ninety One to wind up the fund such as the counterparty becoming\ninsolvent. In the event of Ninety One winding up the fund shareholders, including Canada Life, will be sent their proportionate\nshare of the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the fund.\nGlobal Emerging Markets Equities funds\nThese funds share a common approach in investing primarily in shares in countries where stock markets are not as well\ndeveloped as the UK. This means that they are likely to be in the most volatile group of funds (group 4) and may be more likely\nto see frequent, possibly large, movements in price.\nCanlife Ninety One UK Smaller Companies\nCanlife Schroders UK Smaller Companies\nThese funds aim to generate returns by looking for opportunities to invest in smaller companies in the UK. Shares in smaller\ncompanies can be riskier than those of large companies as the shares can be more difficult to buy and sell and their value is\nmore likely to move up and down over short periods. These funds are often in the most volatile group (group 4).\nCanada Life Limited, registered in England no. 973271. Registered office: Canada Life Place, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire EN6 5BA.

Financial Strength is focused on th e ability of a company to deliver ongoing operation al capability in the \ninterest of its customers and in line with their fa irly held expectations. AKG\u2019s perspective in the as sessment of financial \nstrength is wholly that of a customer of a product or service. From that foundation, this analysis is specifically designed to \ninform financial advisers and assist in their requi red understanding of a company\u2019s operational financ ial strength. \nGiven the underlying customer perspective, the fina ncial strength of companies needs to be focused at an operational \nlevel, specifically on the company that is effectin g the product or service that a customer is selecti ng. This is important, \nbecause from the customer\u2019s perspective it is that company that needs to survive in a form that mainta ins the requisite \noperational characteristics to meet their fairly he ld requirements. And it is thus at this level that the selection needs of the \ncustomers\u2019 advisers must be met. This contrasts to credit rating, which will be undertaken at group or  parent company \nlevel where investment or debt placement etc. is ma de. \nFurther details on how analysis is undertaken is pr ovided at the end of this report and may also be ob tained from AKG.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

Assessment Commentary  Group & Parental Context  Company Analysis  Guide  \n  \nCOMMENTARY \nFinancial Strength Ratings \nCanada Life International Ltd \nCanada Life International Ltd (CLI) has been establ ished for over 30 years in the Isle of Man and rema ins amongst the \nleading offshore providers. It is profitable, pays regular dividends and notwithstanding that dividend s have been paid in \nexcess of profits in 2019 - 2022, it maintains a he althy level of solvency.  \nParental strategy and support remains an important enabler as the business looks to maintain and poten tially further \ndevelop or adjust its positioning. The internationa l offering remains integral to the wider UK market proposition and part \nof the ongoing transformation strategy. \nAt present CLI remains well capitalised with mortal ity business heavily reinsured with Swiss Re and Ge n Re. Management \nis actively monitoring expense levels, lapse activi ty, new business volumes and the level of fee incom e as these will have a \nbearing on earnings and solvency coverage in the me dium term. \nUnit linked business represents the company's core focus, with unit linked assets of \u00a311.9bn [2021: \u00a31 2.5bn]. Unit linked \nliabilities as at 31 December 2022 were \u00a311.7bn, an d these enjoy the support of the Canada Life Group,  Great-West \nLifeco and ultimate parent Power Corporation of Can ada (PCC). CLI is well capitalised for a unit linke d operation, with a \nSCR coverage ratio of 172.0% [163.7%]. \nCLI Institutional Ltd \nIn 2022 CLI Institutional Ltd (CLII) wrote no new p remiums again, so the business flows reflected clai ms only and therefore \na net outflow of \u00a330.6m, a decrease on 2021's net o utflow \u00a3107.6m. \nWith profits of \u00a31.1m [2021: \u00a31.0m] and no dividend  payment, capital increased. Solvency coverage was 244%, up from \n190% at the end of 2021, and was a good position fo r a unit linked operation. \nThe company remains an integral part of the Canada Life International proposition, offering a niche pr oposition to \nsupplement wider business retention. AKG understand s that when the group assesses the capital requirem ents to cover \noperational risks in CLI, it extends this to cover the needs of CLII also, and as such it is AKG's vie w that CLII would receive \nany support necessary from its immediate parent, CL I, or the wider Great-West Life Group. \nCanada Life International Assurance (Ireland) DAC \nWith new business volumes increasing by 55% from \u00a35 58m to \u00a3865m in 2022, CLIAI recorded a profit befor e tax of \n\u00a31.5m [2021: loss \u00a32.3m]. Foreign exchange gains in  the period totalled \u00a31.3m [2021: loss of \u00a31.5m], u nderlying \nadministration expenses of \u00a38.0m were down by 8% on  2021. Overall, administration expenses decreased t o \u00a36.7m \n[2021: \u00a310.2m].  \nMarket value losses on unit linked assets and surre nders contributed to the decrease in AuA, to \u00a37.4bn  at the end of \n2022 [2021: \u00a37.7bn]. \nCLIAI's strategy, within the wider UK Wealth platfo rm transformation strategy, involves a combination of continued growth \nin fee income and ongoing expense management to dri ve profitable growth. \nSolvency coverage increased to 149% [2021: 144%], a nd continued to exceed both the internal minimum an d target levels \nof CLIAI. \nAKG anticipates that any further support will be ma de available by its parent if required; Canada Life  remains demonstrably \ncommitted to the offshore market and behind the tra nsformation and integration of the UK proposition. \nService Rating \nCanada Life International\u2019s vision is to be the int ernational life office of choice for advisers and c ustomers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7e80e12-0931-416e-974c-c9042c00613c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7e80e12-0931-416e-974c-c9042c00613c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "814fefec-bab3-425b-982b-70c4d23fe3d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "hash": "55578424084e1d9e05d943744add84f17467efdfd8011fb7eb1cec7998af5f43"}, "2": {"node_id": "c88c57b0-30c0-4682-a450-7dc95dc02eb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "hash": "6a71be733dc7c0326ca5f52997a2da28c3c5dbc603e73e5fc3f7dad2fd84de6c"}}, "hash": "e415218559b6eca4b464e3a8b22219ac00a26f5e27cdbf6bb044b2335e32ae52", "text": "A stated people-\nled culture of placing the customer at the heart of  business practices underpins this commitment which  is supported by a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a17cbb4-db0a-4003-807f-480c647b613b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a17cbb4-db0a-4003-807f-480c647b613b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90260acb-f586-417f-a9bc-11c1dab6575f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "hash": "8699effd2f586df1008600ba8358cefe646e3d9363c46889fbe41b2ff9c3bad7"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d3f92e5-f1a5-4ee3-842c-87fc53664cc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "hash": "4b51decabca8fb465d8249459d44fc6318c0f0cd65057e3bb4565c8084e3e823"}}, "hash": "7f908e5bf1beb8a3f7c5507af0e4bb1a42b9b18bd290aacd003a81f4871f5f04", "text": "Canada Life International O F F S H O R E  S E C T O R  \n\u00a9 AKG Financial Analytics Ltd 5 03 August 2023 \n Rating & Assessment Commentary  Group & Parental Context  Company Analysis  Guide  market facing service charter that sets out service  standards together with financial penalties that a pply should these not \nbe met. \nCustomer services are now under central ownership w ithin the shared service model. The international b usiness is \nproactive in promoting its technical service expert ise, which has consistently been a core part of its  overall service \napproach.

Although regulatory initiatives such as Consumer Duty \nand Vulnerable Customers are not directly applicabl e in international territories, the International b usiness is aligning with \nthe UK regulated companies, further developing a 'O ne Canada Life' experience and outcomes that are co nsistent across \nall channels. \nImage & Strategy Rating \nThe key and ongoing focus in recent years has been on a consistent presence and offering in the core m arket of the UK. \nAs the market changes further, the business is purs uing a key strategic development to present an inte grated product \nproposition (joining up customer needs in pre and p ost retirement) via platform technology. The opport unity for the \ninternational business to develop its offering maki ng use of its UK organisational reach, broader comp onent competencies \n(such as in investment management), and parental po sition should position it well within this. \nAt a parental level, the aim is for Canada Life\u2019s E uropean businesses to be the leaders in their chose n markets of personal \npension provisions, group protection and wealth man agement, benefiting from leveraging Great-West Life \u2019s extensive \nexperience in North American group insurance and we alth management.  \nThe Canadian group companies - the Great-West Life Assurance Company (Great-West Life) and its subsidi aries, London \nInsurance Group Inc., London Life Insurance Company , Canada Life Financial Corporation, and The Canada  Life Assurance \nCompany amalgamated into one company, The Canada Li fe Assurance Company and a single Canada Life brand  on 1 \nJanuary 2020, and the international business saw a brand refresh in line with this during 2020. \nNotwithstanding (and perhaps in part a result of) i ts uncommon ownership structure, the group continue s to provide for \nlong term strategic resilience; parental support re mains strong and its subsidiaries have been well su pported in testing \nconditions. \nIntegration has already seen the adoption of the si ngle Canada Life brand and management, and the busi ness is now \npursuing increased activity in brand promotion, whi ch it anticipates will see its recognition trending  steadily up, to both \nbetter reflect its existing propositonal footprint and support further growth. \nBusiness Performance Rating \nCanada Life International maintained a strong level  of international bond sales (between CLI, CLII and  CLIAI) with a total \nof \u00a31.6bn, equating to a market share of 24% [2021:  \u00a31.3bn]. \nOffshore Assets under Administration (AuA) increase d overall to \u00a320.3bn as at 31 December 2022. \nBoth CLI and CLII continued to trade profitably.

Its core holdings are leading insuran ce, retirement, wealth \nmanagement and investment businesses, including a p ortfolio of alternative asset investment platforms.  It wholly owns \nPower Financial Corporation (PFC). In 2020, a reorg anisation took place to simplify the corporate stru cture, and refocus \nstrategy. During this period Pansolo Holding Inc., a corporation controlled by the Desmarais Family Re siduary Trust, \nacquired 50.6% of all voting shares of PCC. \nPFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PCC, is an intern ational management and holding company with interes ts in financial \nservices and asset management businesses in Canada,  the United States and Europe. It also has signific ant holdings in a \nportfolio of global companies based in Europe. PFC has been an important participant in the consolidat ion of financial \nservices in Canada. PFC seeks to maintain a balance  between Canadian and non-Canadian earnings, firstl y through the \nAmerican and European operations of Great-West Life co Inc. (in which it owns the controlling stake) an d secondly through \nits investment in Pargesa, a European-based holding  company. \nGreat-West Lifeco Inc. is an international financia l services holding company with interests in life i nsurance, health insurance, \nretirement and investment services, asset managemen t and reinsurance businesses. Great-West Lifeco has  operations in \nCanada, the United States and Europe through Canada  Life, Irish Life, Empower Retirement and Putnam In vestments. At \n31 March 2023, it had AuA of Can$2.6trn and a marke t capitalisation of Can$36bn. \nIn September 2020, Great-West Lifeco Inc. subsidiar y Empower Retirement (Empower) announced it had rea ched a \ndefinitive agreement to acquire the retirement serv ices business of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insuranc e Company, \nstrengthening Empower\u2019s position as the second larg est player in the U.S. retirement market. The total  transaction value \nwas approximately US$3.35bn, and completed in Janua ry 2021, expanding Empower\u2019s reach to more than 12. 2 million \nretirement plan participants and assets to US$834 b illion on behalf of 67,000 plans. \nIn Canada, the company has moved its three Canadian  life insurance companies, The Great-West Life Assu rance \nCompany, London Life Insurance Company and The Cana da Life Assurance Company, to one brand in Canada: Canada \nLife. Following the required approvals, the company  also proceeded with the amalgamation of Great-West  Life, London \nLife and Canada Life, and their holding companies, Canada Life Financial Corporation and London Insura nce Group Inc., \ninto a single life insurance company, The Canada Li fe Assurance Company (CLAC).

The governance arrangements are kept under  continuous review, and refinements are made as app ropriate, \nincluding responding to any future regulatory guide lines or emerging best practice. \nThe Board of Directors of each entity is responsibl e for the governance and oversight of risks in that  company. The Boards \nhave assigned key duties and responsibilities in re lation to risk identification, assessment, measurem ent, monitoring and \ncontrol to a Board Risk Committee in each case. \nEach company also has a comprehensive Risk Manageme nt Framework in place for this purpose.

The first line of defence against risk i s maintained by the \nfunctional areas of the business. The second line o f defence is the oversight and control functions of  the business which \ncontrol, monitor and report risks within the group risk governance structure i.e. risk, actuarial and compliance. The third \nline of defence includes the independent assurance provided by the Internal Audit function. \nAdministration \nThe philosophy of the Canada Life International bus iness is to offer an excellent level of service inc luding delivery of a \nhigh-quality technical expertise, for which it has won and maintained a good reputation.

CLI also outsources the collection of me dical evidence and initial underwriting. \n  \nSTRATEGY \nMarket Positioning \nCanada Life International has a predominantly UK fo cus, with some business also sold into the Isle of Man and the Channel \nIslands. Segmented intermediary distribution is mai ntained through a combined salesforce for both onsh ore and offshore \nindividual business in the UK. It includes estate p lanning and tax specialists, who provide support to  the Intermediary \nDistribution team, developing and maintaining relat ionships with targeted advisory businesses for the offshore proposition.  \nIn recent years, the company has adjusted well to c hanges in the shape of the UK distribution environm ent, which has \nseen a reduction in the volumes afforded by the ban king channel, but opportunities in the wider retail  intermediary sector, \nsuch as with good quality advisory businesses, and via increased use of Discretionary Fund Managers (D FMs) in the market. \nIts DFM adoption was particularly strengthened by t he acquisition of CLIAI, which had established a st rong track record \nin this market segment since launch. As a result, C anada Life International has been able to maintain its market share in \naggregate in a UK market that remains competitive. Canada Life International considers itself well pos itioned for any \nreturning growth in bank channel volumes and to tak e advantage of growing case sizes in the mainstream  market. \nCanada Life International aims to offer value for m oney products with simple and transparent charging structures. Whilst \nsensitive to the need to deliver value for money pr oducts, the company remains committed to its high d egree of technical \ncompetency, believing that technical support for ad visers remains critical and the 'iCan' service is f ocused on delivering \naccessible technical support through a field and he ad office based team of tax and estate planning exp erts. The team \nworks directly with adviser firms providing tailore d support, often covering business generation ideas  and training. The \nteam is also heavily involved in ensuring that the company maintains its comprehensive range of offsho re trusts and \npackaged estate planning solutions. \nProduct flexibility has been enhanced with the laun ch of the Dublin operation to add a jurisdictional option, alongside CLI \nand CLII characteristics, and further by the acquis ition of CLIAI. \nAs part of a customer focused approach, the Canada Life proposition aims to be delivered via a single platform view. This \nwill provide a consistent experience, where all of Canada Life's propositions and solutions can be acc essed from one place \nsupporting the whole end to end client journey.

In July 2015, the company was acquired b y CLG and, renamed \nas CLIAI, is a key component of the international b usiness. \nDue to the similarities of the business of CLIAI an d CLIA, it was more efficient and cost effective to  have the life assurance \nbusinesses of both companies carried on through a s ingle entity in Ireland. Consequently, the business  of CLIA was \ntransferred into CLIAI on 1 January 2016, which now  operates alongside Canada Life's other offshore op erations, Isle of \nMan based CLI and CLII. \nCLIAI is authorised and regulated by the Central Ba nk of Ireland (CBI). In March 2019, in preparation for Brexit, the group \nrestructured its businesses and CLG transferred its  shareholdings in CLIAI and CLA to CLIHC, an Irish holding company, \nfollowing approval by the Central Bank of Ireland ( CBI). The purpose of this restructure was to move a ll Irish Solvency II \nreporting entities under an EU based holding compan y (as CLG was registered in the UK).   \nEffective 1 January 2021 CLIAI is included in the g roup solvency II return of CLIHC for group return s ubmission purposes \nto the CBI. Previously CLIAI was part of CLG and wa s subject to Group Supervision led by the PRA. This  change in \nstructure was completed to ensure all EU entities w ere part of a group return within the EU. \n  \nOPERATIONS \nGovernance System and Structure \nSee Canada Life International Ltd \nIn 2022, there were no material changes to the gove rnance of CLIAI. \nRisk Management \nSee Canada Life International Ltd \nAdministration \nThe launch of the Dublin based operation in May 201 3 (enhanced by the acquisition of CLIAI), provided a further \nmechanism for the delivery of an international prop osition which sits firmly with the consistent exist ing distribution and \nadministration approach. \nThe administration for the Premiere Europe Account (PEA), the Wealth Preservation Europe Account (WPEA ) and the \nInternational Portfolio Bond (IPB) is undertaken by  CLIS, with the exception of the Flexible Investmen t Portfolio (FIP) \nwhich continues to be administered in CLIAI. The ou tsourcing agreement between CLIAI and IPSI for the administration \nof the International Portfolio Bond (IPB) terminate d on 31 December 2018. \nBenchmarks \nSee Canada Life International Ltd \nOutsourcing \nAdministration is largely outsourced to CLIS, with the exception of the FIP which continues to be admi nistered in CLIAI. \nPreviously administration had been outsourced to IP SI for IPB and FIP. As part of a strategic review o f the business and to \nallow consistency in customer experience, process a nd IS systems across the International business, ch anges in the \noutsourcing model were implemented in 2018. This in cluded the migration of policyholder data (IPB & FI P) from IPSI to \nCLIS and the transfer of all remaining Third Party Administration (TPA) responsibilities to CLIS. The result is that the \nbusiness has one single TPA for the administration of CLIAI business and the expected benefits include  improved \nefficiencies and the removal of duplication of effo rt, enhanced customer experience for all CLIAI poli cyholders and cost \nand currency exposure enhancements to the business.  \nInvestment management services are outsourced to CL AM. CLIAI also lists outsourcing agreements with: C LFIS (UK) Ltd \nfor distribution services in the UK; Canada Life Gr oup Services Ltd for tax, payroll and IT Services i n Ireland; and Irish Life \nGroup Services Ltd for HR, compliance and other adm inistration services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68b8041f-88ea-4d7b-9d72-d08d6845bab9": {"__data__": {"id_": "68b8041f-88ea-4d7b-9d72-d08d6845bab9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8a0d18c-b250-4238-9996-e7d5c9625cfa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "hash": "88c8b202779bd0d275da9d2e85146d6273f21d986dc1288d479f15476dc7eeb5"}}, "hash": "52cb771d5e44559bf8f87a899feac2bdd84e99068a5c70cf880b7372687a5f48", "text": "Canada Life International Assurance (Ireland) DAC  O F F S H O R E  S E C T O R   \n\u00a9 AKG Financial Analytics Ltd 21 03 August 2023 \n Company Analysis  Guide  Rating & Assessment Commentary  Group & Parental Context  \n  \nSTRATEGY \nMarket Positioning \nCLIAI is focused on long term investment business f or high net worth clients. \nCLIAI currently sells unit-linked life assurance bo nds to UK residents through UK independent regulate d intermediary \nchannels. The main market for CLIAI is the UK. \nCLIAI operated in Italy on a freedom of services ba sis. CLIAI closed to new business in the Italian ma rket in May 2015. \nAdditional \u2018top-up\u2019 investments to the FIP product continued to be accepted from existing policyholder s until the 8th \nMarch 2019. The company is now closed to all busine ss from the Italian market. In 2022, all in force p olicies of value have \nfully surrendered, bringing to an end the company\u2019s  involvement in the Italian market. \nIn 2022, sales of the company's investment bonds in creased by 55% when compared with 2021, building on  the growth \nachieved in the prior year of 19%. This was driven by strengthening of some institutional relationship s and improvements \nin service quality. These areas are integral to the  positive outlook for the company on sales and earn ings. \nProposition \nCLIAI offered a number of products to its customers . These include: the PEA including a Capital Redemp tion Bond option, \nthe Wealth Preservation Europe Account, and the Int ernational Portfolio Bond (IPB, closed to new busin ess with effect \nfrom 29 March 2018).

This is importan t, because from the \ncustomer\u2019s perspective it is that company (not some  higher corporate entity) that needs to survive in a form that maintains \nthe requisite operational characteristics to meet t heir fairly held requirements. And it is thus at th is level that the selection \nneeds of the customers\u2019 advisers must be met. \nIt is also important to understand the sector appro ach (comparative peer groups) that is adopted in fi nancial strength \nassessment and rating process. \nAt AKG, this is again driven by the end customer pe rspective and the fact that assessment is designed solely for this \npurpose, i.e. as a component in helping customers\u2019 advisers to select between comparable companies com peting to deliver \nrelevant products or services. \nAKG\u2019s focus and approach has remained consistent ov er the years since it commenced assessment and rati ng support for \nthe market. However, coverage, format and presentat ion has rightly evolved over this period, in line w ith the needs and \nexpectations of assessment and rating users in the market. And AKG considers further changes on a cont inual basis.  \nFurther details including an explanation of what is  included in the assessment reports and coverage ca n be found online \nat https://www.akg.co.uk/information/reports/offsho re. \nAKG\u2019s process for assessment and rating is to use a  balanced scorecard of measures and comparative inf ormation, relevant \nto the companies contained within each peer group. This is gathered via Public Information only for no n-participatory \nassessments and public information plus company int eractions with companies for participatory assessme nts. Further \ndetails on AKG\u2019s process can be found at https://ww w.akg.co.uk/information/reports. \nThis includes further information on the different participatory and non-participatory basis and for c ompanies wishing to \nlearn more about participatory assessment AKG is pl eased to outline this and welcomes contact. \nThis is a participatory assessment. \n  \nRATING DEFINITIONS \nOverall Financial Strength Rating \nThe objective is to provide a simple indication of the general financial strength of a company from th e perspective of those \nfinancial advisers who when acting on behalf of the ir clients need to ascertain a company's ability to  deliver sustained \noperational provision of products or services.  \nThe overall rating inherently reflects the mix of b usiness within the company, since different types o f customer or \npolicyholder have different requirements and expect ations, and the company may have particular strengt hs and \nweaknesses in respect of its key product or service  areas. However, it also takes account of compariso n across the sector \nin which it is assessed. \nThe rating takes into account those of the followin g criteria which are relevant (depending upon the c ompany's mix of \nbusiness in-force): capital and asset position, exp ense position and profitability, structure (and siz e) of funds within the \ncompany, parental strength (and likely attitude tow ards supporting the company), operational capabilit y, management", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d70861d-43df-4981-a5a5-c0019536b1c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d70861d-43df-4981-a5a5-c0019536b1c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "33ba3404-2b72-4ff5-957b-2901bec09a26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "akg-report-canada-life-international-financial-strength-assessment.pdf"}, "hash": "14a518810856597e90c39913daae60e4e2e49698657bfb28502f1dc0c710b992"}}, "hash": "bf727f477a71856d43e7e421742be9a29ab37dedb5cd7408eef403b079b5ddd6", "text": "Canada Life International O F F S H O R E  S E C T O R  \n\u00a9 AKG Financial Analytics Ltd 25 03 August 2023 \n Company Analysis  Guide  Rating & Assessment Commentary  Group & Parental Context  strength and capability, strategic position and rat ionale, brand and image, typical fund performance a chievements or \nproduct / service features, its operating environme nt and ability to withstand external forces. \nRating Scale A B+ B B- C D \u0003 \n Superior Very Strong Strong Satisfactory Weak Very Weak Not applicable \n \nWith Profits Financial Strength Rating \nThe objective is to provide a simple indication of the with profits financial strength of a company, w here it currently offers \nwith profits business or has existing with profits business within it. \nThis is from the perspective of those financial adv isers who when acting on behalf of their clients, f or this product type, \nneed to ascertain a company's ability to deliver su stained operational provision of with profits funds , products or \npropositions.

The fund(s) \nyou choose may invest in assets such as stocks and shares, \nproperty, gilts, corporate bonds, or cash.

The following information \nis based on our understanding of current UK and Isle \nof Man tax legislation as of April 2022, although the tax \ntreatment of your Account will depend on your country of \ntax residency at the time you make withdrawals or fully \nsurrender your Account. The tax position of your Account \nmay change in future, and you may be subject to additional \ntaxes or costs which we have not considered. \nWe strongly recommend you seek your own independent \ntax advice.\nCorporation tax\nWe pay no corporate taxes in the Isle of Man on the capital \ngrowth or income which accrue to any of the funds linked to \nyour Account. By contrast, UK life assurance funds must pay \ntax at a rate of 20% on both income and gains.\nCapital gains tax\nAny investment gains made because of switching the \nunderlying funds within your Account do not give rise to a \nUK capital gains tax liability. Any benefits taken from the \nAccount are not subject to Capital Gains Tax but may be \nsubject to income tax.\nIncome tax  \nUK resident Account holders are assessed under income \ntax when certain transactions occur. These transactions \nare known as chargeable events and if a chargeable event \noccurs, a chargeable gain calculation is made to establish if \nany income tax is payable. The main chargeable events are:\n\u2022 When the Account ends because a Life Assured dies and  \n the death benefit becomes payable\n\u2022 If the Account or any of the individual policies within it  \n are assigned to a new owner for money or money\u2019s worth\n\u2022 For any withdrawals that exceed the 5% tax-deferred  \n allowance\n\u2022 If you fully surrender the Account or any of the individual  \n policies within it\nIf a chargeable gain arises it will be assessed to income tax. \nThis will be based on your highest marginal rate of income \ntax at that time. Top-slicing relief is available. What is the 5% tax deferred allowance? \nYou can withdraw up to 5% of your premium each year for \nup to 20 years without any immediate liability to income \ntax. This is known as the 5% tax-deferred allowance. \nUnused amounts can be \u2018stored\u2019 for use in later years, \nincluding years beyond year 20. Deferring an assessment \nto income tax may be beneficial for several reasons, such \nas if you expect your level of income to fall in future, or if \nyou plan to move abroad away from the UK tax net. If you \nwithdraw more than a total of 5% of the premium each \nyear, the excess will give rise to an immediate income tax \ncharge at your highest marginal rate. Top-slicing relief may \nbe available. \nAny financial adviser charge deductions from your Account \nwill count towards your 5% tax deferred allowance and may \nhave tax implications. It is important that you discuss these \nwith your financial adviser. Any fund adviser charges do not \ncount towards your 5% tax deferred allowance. \nInheritance tax  \nInheritance tax planning is becoming increasingly relevant, \nas more individuals fall within its remit. Your executors may \nhave to pay inheritance tax on any money they receive from \nyour Account if you die. If you put your Account in trust your \nexecutors may not have to pay as much or any inheritance \ntax.\nWe offer several trust options which can be used to help to \nreduce the impact of inheritance tax on your estate. These \nare the Discounted Gift Trust, the Bare and Discretionary \nGift Trusts and Gift and Loan Trust and the Excluded \nProperty Trust. The Discounted Gift Trust and Gift and Loan \nTrust need to be considered at the outset as part of the \nAccount application, as these trusts cannot be added to an \nexisting Account after it has been issued.  \nWe also offer the Probate Trust which can be considered at \nthe outset or added to an Account after issue. The Probate \nTrust has no effect on inheritance tax, but it allows your \nbeneficiaries to have access to the value of your Account on \nyour death immediately, without the need to obtain Isle of \nMan or UK Grant of Probate. \nPlease contact your financial adviser if you require any \nmore information on any of these trust options. \n Delta Account Key Features  9", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c90b057-85ae-4764-a0cb-17336b2188c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c90b057-85ae-4764-a0cb-17336b2188c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "delta-account-key-features.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3374b36-37e5-4977-b436-47652640e5ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "delta-account-key-features.pdf"}, "hash": "48cf07625352795957d76ae00ad2ad2f127e691f55e4882b6f7334cc253a09db"}}, "hash": "48cf07625352795957d76ae00ad2ad2f127e691f55e4882b6f7334cc253a09db", "text": "What if my country of residence changes?\nYour personalised illustration is based on your present \ncountry of residence.

If you are in any doubt \nabout your tax status you should consult your financial \nadviser. How tax affects you will depend on your individual \ncircumstances.\nThe following information regarding taxation is based on \nour current understanding of UK legislation, which may \nchange in future.\nCorporation tax\nWe pay no corporate taxes in the Isle of Man on the capital \ngrowth or income which accrue to any of the underlying \ninvestments linked to your Account. By contrast, UK life \nassurance funds must pay tax at a rate of 20% on both \nincome and gains.\nCapital gains tax\nAny investment gains made because of switching the \nunderlying investments choices within your Account do \nnot give rise to a UK capital gains tax liability. Any benefits \ntaken from the Account are not subject to Capital Gains Tax, \nbut may be subject to income tax.\nIncome tax\nDepending on your country of tax residence at the time, \nyou may be assessed under income tax when certain \ntransactions occur within the Account. These transactions \nare known as chargeable events and if a chargeable event \noccurs that gives rise to a chargeable gain, you may be \nliable to pay income tax on the gain. The main chargeable \nevents are:\n\u2022 Where the Account ends because a life assured dies and  \n the death benefit becomes payable\n\u2022 If the Account or any of the individual policies within it  \n are assigned to a new owner for money or money\u2019s worth\u2022 For any withdrawals that exceed the 5% tax-deferred  \n allowance in any policy year, or the cumulative 5% tax  \n deferred allowance over the lifetime of the Account\n\u2022 If you fully surrender the Account or any of the individual  \n policies within it \nIf a chargeable gain arises it will be assessed to income tax.  \nThis will be based on your highest marginal rate of income \ntax at that time. Top-slicing relief is available.\nWhat is the 5% tax deferred allowance?\nYou can withdraw up to 5% of your premium each year for \nup to 20 years without any immediate liability to income \ntax. This is known as the 5% tax-deferred allowance. Unused \namounts can be \u2018stored\u2019 for use in later years, including \nyears beyond year 20. Deferring an assessment to income tax \nmay be beneficial for several reasons, such as if you expect \nyour level of income to fall in future, or if you plan to move \nabroad away from the UK tax net. If you withdraw more than \na total of 5% of the premium each policy year, the excess will \ngive rise to an immediate income tax charge at your highest \nmarginal rate. Top-slicing relief may be available.\nAny financial adviser charge deductions from your Account \nwill count towards your 5% tax deferred allowance and may \nhave tax implications. It is important that you discuss these \nwith your financial adviser. Any fund adviser charges do not \ncount towards your 5% tax deferred allowance.\nInheritance tax\nInheritance tax planning is becoming increasingly relevant, \nas more individuals fall within its remit.\nWe offer several trust options which can be used to help to \nreduce the impact of inheritance tax on your estate. These \nare the Gift Trust and Gift and Loan Trust. The Gift and Loan \nTrust needs to be considered at the outset as part of the \nAccount application, as this trust cannot be added to an \nexisting Account after it has been issued.\nWe also offer the Probate Trust which can be considered at \nthe outset or added to an Account after issue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "605e3790-18fc-4215-89cd-1e163aff022f": {"__data__": {"id_": "605e3790-18fc-4215-89cd-1e163aff022f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "elite-account-key-features.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "458493e6-cd2b-41f0-a47c-094fe95aa02f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "elite-account-key-features.pdf"}, "hash": "b610eb05ad406658ca2c165477a7c40f1d26147fa84bf1a7257200a7cf43d36f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9da89c5-c0b7-4e88-83a9-ebdd2b198aa7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "elite-account-key-features.pdf"}, "hash": "74a9d92b285ba7a1b090e8978ddef5bdc18724ec8b419126acab5a3cb189da7d"}}, "hash": "d9412ce2b920024abeb9b1e97db91f1911f65398ed8dbd22d7e3c4f459dd636d", "text": "The Probate \nTrust has no effect on inheritance tax, but it allows your \nbeneficiaries to have access to the value of your Account on \nyour death immediately, without the need to obtain Isle of \nMan or UK Grant of Probate.\nPlease contact your financial adviser if you require any \nmore information on any of these trust options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0978c51f-cb8d-447a-a13f-01722b73414d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0978c51f-cb8d-447a-a13f-01722b73414d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "elite-account-key-features.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4617045-466c-4d4e-90b7-c9128c5d715a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "elite-account-key-features.pdf"}, "hash": "1db997609d2239f829da01438e3f10826b5bb637f2d9b51ddb906862b71f911e"}}, "hash": "f116a17f78924f4132604061b21d5c7e55958657a52af7da07402ed4a6917ab8", "text": "10  Elite Account Key Features  Elite Account Key Features  11Further information\nHow can I find out the current value of my \nAccount?\nIf you register for a MyAccess account through the \u2018Log \nin\u2019 link on our website www.canadlife.co.uk and you can \nobtain an indicative Account value at any time. \nWe will provide you with quarterly transaction statements \nwhich will also show the ongoing value of your Account.\nYou can also contact us at any time to obtain an indicative \nvalue, although note that any values we provide are not \nguaranteed.\nCan I change my mind?\nYes, under Isle of Man insurance regulation, you have the \nright to cancel your Account within 30 days of receipt of \nyour documents.\nTo exercise your right to cancel, please complete and return \nto us the cancellation notice provided to you with your \nAccount documents.

You pay a regular amount to us (the \npremium), which is invested in your choice of unit linked \ninvestments to build up a future capital lump sum. \nYou can invest any amount subject to the minimum of \n\u00a3500 monthly or \u00a36,000 yearly (or currency equivalent). At \nthe outset, you can choose to denominate your Account in \neither sterling (GBP), US Dollars (USD) or euro (EUR), but \nonce issued we cannot change the Account currency. \nEach Account is made up of ten identical policies. You may \nfind this structure useful as it can be used to make future \nwithdrawals from your Account more tax efficient (please \nrefer to the \u2018What taxes are applicable?\u2019 section).\nHow does the Offshore Savings Account work?\nYou can apply for an Account on your own, or with someone \nelse (which is known as a joint Account). All applicants must \ncomplete the application form and be aged between 18 and \n89 when the Account starts.\nYou will not automatically be recorded as a life assured on \nthe Account unless you complete the relevant section of the \napplication form. If you want someone else or several other \npeople to be lives assured, you must provide their details on \nthe application form. The Account can hold up to six lives \nassured and there must be at least one life assured who is \nno older than 79. Setting up the Account with multiple lives \nmakes it possible for the Account to continue after your death, \nand in that case, it would end on the death of the last life \nassured to die.How much can I invest?\nYou can pay the regular monthly and yearly premiums by \ndirect debit. The single and yearly premiums may be paid \nby cheque or by direct bank transfer. For US Dollar or euro \npremiums the currency equivalent will apply.\n \nThese minimums are net of any adviser charge deductions.\nHow flexible is it?\nTo maximise the opportunity for capital growth, you need to \nbe able to continue to pay your regular premium for at least \nthe first three years (the minimum contribution period), if \nnot longer. You can increase the amount of your regular \npremiums at any time. \nYou can stop paying altogether without penalty at any \ntime. However, if you stop paying your premium during \nthe minimum contribution period, we will continue to take \nthe establishment charges each month until the end of this \nperiod. Any adviser charge payments will stop as soon as \nyou stop paying premiums.\nOnce the minimum contribution period has ended, you can \nreduce the regular premium amount if you wish, subject to \nthe minimum premium level in the table above.\nSingle premiums can be added at any time.Questions and Answers\nMinimum initial premium\n Monthly Yearly Single\n \u00a3500 \u00a36,000 \u00a37,500\nMinimum additional premium\n Monthly Yearly Single\n \u00a3125 \u00a31,500 \u00a37,500", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc0a8b97-1f0b-4dae-8540-427d52941afe": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc0a8b97-1f0b-4dae-8540-427d52941afe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "offshore-savings-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19dcf2b7-86f6-4906-8157-446e5dd87f5c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "offshore-savings-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "99d6b62bd6e7a59a66654e7b734b17a08abbb71d38b0b9181fc1aedf042fb530"}}, "hash": "99d6b62bd6e7a59a66654e7b734b17a08abbb71d38b0b9181fc1aedf042fb530", "text": "6  Offshore Savings Account Key Features  Where are my premiums invested?\nYour premiums are invested in your selection of funds from \nthe Canada Life International Core fund range.

If you \nwithdraw more than a total of 5% of the premium each \nyear, the excess will give rise to an immediate income tax \ncharge at your highest marginal rate. Top-slicing relief may \nbe available. \nThe use of adviser charge deductions from your Account \nwill affect your 5% tax deferred allowance and may have \ntax implications. It is important that you discuss these with \nyour financial adviser. Any fund adviser charges do not \ncount towards your 5% tax deferred allowance.\nInheritance tax  \nInheritance tax planning is becoming increasingly relevant, \nas more individuals fall within its remit. \nWe offer a Gift Trust option (both bare and discretionary) \nwhich can be used to help to reduce the impact of \ninheritance tax on your estate, and this trust can be added \nat the outset or to an existing Account after it has been \nissued.  \nWe also offer the Probate Trust which can be considered at \nthe outset or added to an Account after issue. The Probate \nTrust has no effect on inheritance tax, but it does allow your \nbeneficiaries to have access to the value of your Account on \nyour death immediately, without the need to obtain UK or \nIsle of Man Grant of Probate. \nPlease contact your financial adviser if you require any \nmore information on any of these trust options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02bb939b-03ea-4491-a8be-14cf75aec9ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "02bb939b-03ea-4491-a8be-14cf75aec9ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "offshore-savings-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb251568-f442-409e-9aa1-61df94f79531", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "offshore-savings-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "cf441a12a0771b84f8b6134301406fbe1814d8f07a9ceb79b9a6474c6f5a368b"}}, "hash": "1b4c52cf983164bd983d6029df0cd3b1ca238da9eb4e951132e807032f7bfb87", "text": "How can I find out the current value of my \nAccount?\nIf you register for a MyAccess account through the \u2018Log in\u2019 \nlink on our website www.canadalife.co.uk you can obtain an \nindicative Account value at any time.\nWe will provide you with an annual valuation statement and \nyou can also contact us at any time to obtain an indicative \nvalue, although please note this is not guaranteed if you are \nlooking to surrender your Account.   \nCan I change my mind?\nYes, under Isle of Man insurance regulation, you have the \nright to cancel your Offshore Savings Account within 30 days \nof receipt of your documents.\nTo exercise your right to cancel, please complete and \nreturn to us the cancellation notice provided to you with \nyour Offshore Savings Account documents.

As the underlying investments \nbelong to us, there will only be one holder of each \ninvestment, and although several investors may have their \npolicies linked to a particular investment, the compensation \nscheme would only treat us as a single investor. Therefore, \nany compensation received would have to be split between \nall of our relevant Account holders \u2013 as would be the case \nwith any life assurance or other company in this situation.\n \n10  Offshore Savings Account Key Features  Offshore Savings Account Key Features  11", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d7f599c-bb2b-4a2d-839c-3af4dc0210b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d7f599c-bb2b-4a2d-839c-3af4dc0210b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "offshore-savings-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "22129125-98dd-449a-a9b1-a39ab0a10a9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "offshore-savings-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "bf51ff456152c6508e02b89a58ba1cf1978af571435b0108651a5ede26c03c67"}}, "hash": "fbd433221e52a64db8d9f18041500972c4cdc72795c62d0b3a856c2675e46622", "text": "Canada Life International Limited, registered in the Isle of Man no. 033178C.

If you are in any doubt \nabout your tax status you should consult your financial \nadviser.\nCorporation tax\nWe pay no corporate taxes in the Isle of Man on the capital \ngrowth or income which accrue to any of the underlying \ninvestments linked to your Account. By contrast, UK life \nassurance funds have to pay tax at a rate of 20% on both \nincome and gains. \nCapital gains tax\nAny investment gains made as a result of switching the \nunderlying investments choices within your Account do \nnot give rise to a UK capital gains tax liability. Any benefits \ntaken from the Account are not subject to Capital Gains Tax, \nbut may be subject to income tax.\nIncome tax \nDepending on your country of tax residence at the time, \nyou may be assessed under income tax when certain \ntransactions occur within the Account. These transactions \nare known as chargeable events and if a chargeable event \noccurs that gives rise to a chargeable gain, you may be \nliable to pay income tax on the gain. The main chargeable \nevents are:\n\u2022 For the life assurance basis, when the Account ends  \n because a life assured dies and the death benefit  \n becomes payable\n\u2022 If the Account or any of the individual policies within it  \n are assigned to a new owner for money or money\u2019s worth \n\u2022 For the capital redemption bond basis only, when the  \n Account ends at the maturity date and the maturity value  \n is paid\n\u2022 For any withdrawals that exceed the 5% tax-deferred  \n allowance\u2022 If you fully surrender the Account or any of the individual  \n policies within it\nIf a chargeable gain arises it will be assessed to income tax. \nThis will be based on your highest marginal rate of income \ntax at that time. Top-slicing relief is available. \nWhat is the 5% tax deferred allowance? \nYou can withdraw up to 5% of your premium each year for \nup to 20 years without any immediate liability to income \ntax. This is known as the 5% tax-deferred allowance. \nUnused amounts can be \u2018stored\u2019 for use in later years, \nincluding years beyond year 20. Deferring an assessment \nto income tax may be beneficial for several reasons, such \nas if you expect your level of income to fall in future, or if \nyou plan to move abroad away from the UK tax net. If you \nwithdraw more than a total of 5% of the premium each \nyear, the excess will give rise to an immediate income tax \ncharge at your highest marginal rate. Top-slicing relief may \nbe available. \nAny financial adviser charge deductions from your Account \nwill count towards your 5% tax deferred allowance and \nmay have tax implications. It is important that you discuss \nthese with your financial adviser. Any fund adviser or \ndiscretionary fund manager charges do not count towards \nyour 5% tax deferred allowance. \nInheritance tax \nInheritance tax planning is becoming increasingly relevant, \nas more individuals fall within its remit. \nWe offer several trust options which can be used to help to \nreduce the impact of inheritance tax on your estate. These \nare the Discounted Gift Trust, the Gift Trust and Gift and \nLoan Trust. The Discounted Gift Trust and Gift and Loan \nTrust need to be considered at the outset as part of the \nAccount application, as these trusts cannot be added to an \nexisting Account after it has been issued.  \nWe also offer the Probate Trust which can be considered at \nthe outset or added to an Account after issue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "160a2595-1cdb-450e-b422-16809048b877": {"__data__": {"id_": "160a2595-1cdb-450e-b422-16809048b877", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "premiere-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c387c4a4-5891-452e-9052-b4235e4275a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "premiere-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "93ca2027e8babe565fed3219d2a631033549da535e1e7c44784607c9039b828d"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee1053d7-f565-4fa3-95a4-9cb193dd395e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "premiere-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "7e737ac3020f0558367c7b70c1556fd0d4a21a4c4f89113bdc3a8a4e1eef1ad2"}}, "hash": "fe684b9b0fce1f43dde0100070f8e5a18ea0744e20d86ab1a09db0c1a2be413a", "text": "The Probate \nTrust has no effect on inheritance tax, but it allows your \nbeneficiaries to have access to the value of your Account on \nyour death immediately, without the need to obtain Isle of \nMan or UK Grant of Probate. \nPlease contact your financial adviser if you require any \nmore information on any of these trust options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd1cd77-2dff-4886-bb44-7c4bffd27185": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd1cd77-2dff-4886-bb44-7c4bffd27185", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "premiere-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91b8a148-245b-469e-9921-5eba19c362e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "premiere-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "29aad71372673cc42dbc1949d1671bb76f578d584d899dfc14bd8fc69f5df257"}}, "hash": "29aad71372673cc42dbc1949d1671bb76f578d584d899dfc14bd8fc69f5df257", "text": "12  Premiere Account Key Features  The information regarding taxation is \nbased on our current understanding of UK \nlegislation which may change in future.

If you are in any doubt about \nyour tax status you should consult your financial adviser. How \ntax affects you will depend on your individual circumstances.\nThe following information regarding taxation is based on \nour current understanding of UK legislation, which may \nchange in future.\nCorporation tax\nWe pay no corporate taxes in the Isle of Man on the capital \ngrowth or income which accrue to any of the underlying \ninvestments linked to your Account. By contrast, UK life \nassurance funds must pay tax at a rate of 20% on both \nincome and gains.Capital gains tax\nAny investment gains made because of switching the \nunderlying investments choices within your Account do \nnot give rise to a UK capital gains tax liability. Any benefits \ntaken from the Account are not subject to Capital Gains Tax, \nbut may be subject to income tax.\nIncome tax\nDepending on your country of tax residence at the time, you \nmay be assessed under income tax when certain transactions \noccur within the Account. These transactions are known as \nchargeable events and if a chargeable event occurs that gives \nrise to a chargeable gain, you may be liable to pay income tax \non the gain. The main chargeable events are:\n\u2022 Where the Account ends because a life assured dies and  \n the death benefit becomes payable\n\u2022 If the Account or any of the individual policies within it  \n are assigned to a new owner for money or money\u2019s worth\n\u2022 For any withdrawals that exceed the 5% tax-deferred  \n allowance in any policy year, or the cumulative 5% tax  \n deferred allowance over the lifetime of the Account\n\u2022 If you fully surrender the Account or any of the individual  \n policies within it \nIf a chargeable gain arises it will be assessed to income tax.  \nThis will be based on your highest marginal rate of income \ntax at that time. Top-slicing relief is available.\nWhat is the 5% tax deferred allowance?\nYou can withdraw up to 5% of your premium each year for \nup to 20 years without any immediate liability to income \ntax. This is known as the 5% tax-deferred allowance. Unused \namounts can be \u2018stored\u2019 for use in later years, including \nyears beyond year 20.

As the underlying investments belong \nto us, there will only be one holder of each investment, and \nalthough several investors may have their policies linked to a \nparticular investment, the compensation scheme would only \ntreat us as one investor. Therefore, any compensation received \nwould have to be split between all our relevant policyholders \u2013 \nas would be the case with any life assurance or other company \nin this situation.Further information", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f6c243d-18fa-4cd4-935a-4613a58ace04": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f6c243d-18fa-4cd4-935a-4613a58ace04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "prestige-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3cc9144e-e48a-4237-a215-5407b58a2d04", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "prestige-account-key-features-document.pdf"}, "hash": "5c0c73e954e9ab2f5af21625f0d6b2045802a7345c8181d34db19aae4902906f"}}, "hash": "5c0c73e954e9ab2f5af21625f0d6b2045802a7345c8181d34db19aae4902906f", "text": "This paper is made from recycled materials\nI-033 \u2013 0823R/BContact\nHow to contact us \nIf you have any questions regarding your Account, we \nrecommend that you contact your financial adviser in the \nfirst instance.
